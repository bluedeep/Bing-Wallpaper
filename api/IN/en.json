		"description": "Mangaluru sits on India's western coast, facing the Arabian Sea, with a shoreline defined by long beaches, river mouths and an active maritime presence. The city's location has shaped its identity for centuries, linking it to coastal trade, fishing activity, and the wider routes of the Konkan. Its seafront is less of an attraction and more a fundamental part of how Mangaluru has grown, connecting land, water and people in a way that feels instinctive to the region.\nLife along the waterfront carries its own rhythm. Fishing communities continue practices refined over generations, relying on seasonal tides, estuaries and monsoon patterns that influence when they sail, mend nets or bring in their catch. These routines sit alongside the city's commercial port, creating a coastline where tradition and industry coexist without losing the character that has long defined coastal Karnataka. The culture here is shaped by work, water and time, giving the shore a deep-rooted sense of continuity.\nWinter changes the experience for travellers. Clearer skies, cooler evenings and calmer seas make this one of the most inviting seasons for exploring the beaches, with softer light and open horizons creating an easy, unhurried atmosphere. It is the time when Mangaluru's coast feels brightest and most accessible, offering simple moments shaped by the season rather than spectacle.",

		"description": "On a windswept plateau in eastern Türkiye, along the border with Armenia, the ruins of the ancient city of Ani rise from the landscape with striking clarity. A millennium ago, Ani was a thriving Armenian capital on a major Silk Road route, its fortifications and busy streets shaping trade and culture across the region. Today, the city is quiet, but its outline still carries the weight of its past.\nThe image shows the Church of St. Gregory, one of Ani's most striking survivors. Built from dark volcanic stone, its tall cylindrical tower stands over the plateau with the same precision that once defined the city. Ani was known as the 'City of 1,001 Churches,' and its architects pushed new ideas in arches, domes and facades that later influenced Gothic tradition. Even in ruin, the design remains deliberate and unmistakable.\nAni's decline unfolded through earthquakes, invasions and shifting trade routes, yet the city never fully disappeared. Archaeologists continue to find new details, and conservation work fights erosion and time. Walking here feels less like exploring a ruin and more like meeting a city determined to keep its story alive.",

		"description": "In Japan's colder months, there's a morning moment when stillness breaks—not with wind or footsteps, but with a bright, rolling call that sweeps across the water. Whooper swans have touched down. One loud whoop—and winter suddenly feels awake. These birds migrate from Siberia and the Russian Far East, choosing Japan as their seasonal home because its lakes offer what long-distance travellers crave: open water, steady food and a safe place to rest. One of their favourite destinations is Kotoku Pond in the Kantō region on Japan's largest island.\nWhooper swans make an impression from the start, with tall necks, white feathers and yellow-and-black bills. Add a call that carries for kilometres and they become impossible to miss. Families migrate together, keep close on the water and coordinate flights with those trumpet-like notes. At places like Kotoku Pond, dawn departures are the highlight. While in Japan, their diet is simple: grains, aquatic plants and grasses. Moreover, healthy wetlands attract them and their return each winter signals that the ecosystem is thriving.",

		"description": "Three… two… one… wait—hold that countdown. It's not New Year's yet, but the Oberbaum Bridge already feels as if Berlin in Germany hit its 'celebrate' button ahead of time. On this night, the bridge transforms from a simple river crossing into a runway where this city taxis toward midnight, engines humming, fireworks warming up and the crowd collectively practicing its 'Happy New Year!' voice.\nWedged perfectly between Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg, the bridge sits at the meeting point of two neighbourhoods across the River Spree that approach the eve with completely different strategies. Friedrichshain shows up with club beats and street snacks. Kreuzberg brings laid-back bars and last-minute toasts. The Oberbaum Bridge? From here, the scene is pure improvisation—bursts of colour from rooftops, random sparkles from the riverbanks and occasional 'Was that meant to go sideways?' moments. The bridge's iconic red-brick towers watch over it all, steady and unfazed. These towers once marked the divide between East and West Berlin, but tonight they mark something far better: togetherness. Here's to crossing into another year—one step, one cheer and one firework at a time.",

		"description": "Do you feel as if you have a whole year's worth of rest to catch up on? Then you can relate to this Arctic fox, cosily tucked among the rocky outcroppings of the frozen tundra. Whether the new year greets you with biting cold or under a warm sun, take five extra minutes to stretch before diving into the 365 days ahead.\nEver wondered why we have 365 days in a year? It's because the Gregorian calendar—introduced in 1582—is based on a solar year: the time it takes Earth to orbit the sun. The stars have our backs, but the plans we make for the months ahead are all on us.\nLet's start the year with a clean slate. Here are a few ideas for New Year's resolutions. Simple things like reading, taking nature walks or practicing mindfulness cost nothing and can really boost your quality of life. Or maybe you're dreaming bigger: moving abroad, taking up scuba diving or learning an endangered language? Take a deep breath—and perhaps sleep on it a little longer.",

		"description": "Seeing Venice from above is mesmerising, but this Italian gem's true magic lies within its walls and waterways. Founded in the 5th century on a cluster of islands in the Venetian Lagoon, the early settlement rose from marshland to become a maritime powerhouse. By the Middle Ages, it had evolved into a major hub for trade between Europe and the East, fuelling immense wealth and cultural growth. The city's grandeur shines through its Gothic palaces, Renaissance art and landmarks such as St Mark's Basilica, the Doge's Palace and the Rialto Bridge.\nVenice is celebrated not only for its iconic architecture and interwoven canals but also for the brilliant minds who shaped its legacy. 'The Travels of Marco Polo' chronicles the adventures of the Venetian merchant and explorer and Antonio Vivaldi—composer of 'The Four Seasons'—was also born here. The city has inspired timeless works, including Thomas Mann's 'Death in Venice,' Shakespeare's 'The Merchant of Venice' and 'Othello' and Henry James's novella 'The Aspern Papers.'\nToday, Venice balances historic charm with modern challenges—from preserving fragile architecture to managing tourism. Gondolas glide past centuries-old facades, while festivals like Carnevale keep traditions alive.",

		"description": "Our picture of the day takes us to the Swiss village of Lauterbrunnen, where the Staubbach Falls shimmers in the distance beyond a quiet alpine valley. This is the landscape a young traveller, J.R.R. Tolkien, crossed during a hiking trip in 1911, long before he became the storyteller behind 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit.' Its soaring cliffs, silver waterfalls and crisp mountain air left a lasting impression and are believed to have inspired his vision of Rivendell, the elven refuge hidden deep in Middle-earth.\nOn January 3—Tolkien's birthday—fans across the globe celebrate Tolkien Day, raising a toast at 9 PM to 'The Professor.' The tradition, started by The Tolkien Society in 1972, recalls both Frodo's toast to Bilbo and the writer's years at Oxford, where he spent a lifetime shaping modern fantasy—interweaving language, legend and moral courage into timeless tales. Today, admirers honour not just an author but a world-maker—one who showed that even the smallest journey can lead to greatness and that wonder awaits, ever-present, just beyond the familiar.",

		"description": "Kings Mountain in Alaska's Chugach Mountains, United States, isn't just another bump on the horizon—it's the kind of rugged beauty that makes you slow down and stare. Rising nearly 1,800 metres and sitting roughly 35 kilometres northeast of Palmer, this peak towers over mile 75 of the Glenn Highway, a route famous for its dramatic scenery. Its slopes bear the marks of ancient glaciers, etched into ridges and valleys that seem tailor-made for adventure.",
