		"description": "One moment the canopy is still, and the next, a burst of black and white shoots through it like a living exclamation mark. That's the black-and-white ruffed lemur, a primate that doesn't shy away from announcing itself with raucous calls. Its coat comes in bold patches, and the thick ruff frames its face. Roughly 92% of the lemur's diet is fruit, with leaves, nectar, seeds and the occasional fungus making up the rest. When trees are heavy with figs and other seasonal offerings, this creature moves quickly through the dense forest. As it laps up nectar, pollen sticks to its snout, turning it into one of the habitat's most effective pollinators.\nMany people recognise lemurs from the animated movie 'Madagascar,' but the real animal faces a much harsher reality. This tree-dwelling species is critically endangered. It survives in increasingly fragmented forests where habitat loss remains a constant threat driven by deforestation and hunting. Still, conservation groups are working to safeguard what remains, hoping the lemur's morning calls continue to ring out through the treetops.",

		"description": "On a windswept plateau in eastern Türkiye, along the border with Armenia, the ruins of the ancient city of Ani rise from the landscape with striking clarity. A millennium ago, Ani was a thriving Armenian capital on a major Silk Road route, its fortifications and busy streets shaping trade and culture across the region. Today, the city is quiet, but its outline still carries the weight of its past.\nThe image shows the Church of St. Gregory, one of Ani's most striking survivors. Built from dark volcanic stone, its tall cylindrical tower stands over the plateau with the same precision that once defined the city. Ani was known as the 'City of 1,001 Churches,' and its architects pushed new ideas in arches, domes and facades that later influenced Gothic tradition. Even in ruin, the design remains deliberate and unmistakable.\nAni's decline unfolded through earthquakes, invasions and shifting trade routes, yet the city never fully disappeared. Archaeologists continue to find new details, and conservation work fights erosion and time. Walking here feels less like exploring a ruin and more like meeting a city determined to keep its story alive.",

		"description": "In Japan's colder months, there's a morning moment when stillness breaks—not with wind or footsteps, but with a bright, rolling call that sweeps across the water. Whooper swans have touched down. One loud whoop—and winter suddenly feels awake. These birds migrate from Siberia and the Russian Far East, choosing Japan as their seasonal home because its lakes offer what long-distance travellers crave: open water, steady food and a safe place to rest. One of their favourite destinations is Kotoku Pond in the Kantō region on Japan's largest island.\nWhooper swans make an impression from the start, with tall necks, white feathers and yellow-and-black bills. Add a call that carries kilometres, and they become impossible to miss. Families migrate together, keep close on the water and coordinate flights with those trumpet-like notes. At places like Kotoku Pond, dawn departures are the highlight. While in Japan, their diet is simple: grains, aquatic plants and grasses. Moreover, healthy wetlands attract them, and their return each winter signals that the ecosystem is thriving.",

		"description": "Three… two… one… pause—Toronto never rushes the moment. The city likes a warm-up: the CN Tower testing its colours, the harbour breeze tuning itself, streetcars gliding as if they already know a celebration is on the way. On New Year's Eve, Toronto doesn't wait for midnight; it builds toward it, as crowds drift toward the waterfront for a front-row view of what's about to ignite. At Nathan Phillips Square, skates trace sparkling loops as the clock nears twelve. Down by Harbourfront, fireworks test their reflections on Lake Ontario before bursting into the sky.\nAcross Canada, the new year arrives with a mix of grit and warmth. Cities turn tranquil plazas into party grounds, complete with fireworks, concerts and quick sips of something hot. Families gather in parks, friends take over rooftops and someone—somewhere—always gets the countdown wrong. From Halifax's salty air to Vancouver's mountain silhouettes, the country braves the cold together and calls it a celebration. And when midnight hits, the country erupts—colour, sound, cheers, all rising at once. For a brief, brilliant stretch, Toronto glows its way into the new year—unified, loud and beautifully alive, as seen in today's image.",

		"description": "Do you feel as if you have a whole year's worth of rest to catch up on? Then you can relate to this Arctic fox, cosily tucked among the rocky outcroppings of the frozen tundra. Whether the new year greets you with biting cold or under a warm sun, take five extra minutes to stretch before diving into the 365 days ahead. Ever wondered why we have 365 days in a year? It's because the Gregorian calendar—introduced in 1582—is based on a solar year: the time it takes Earth to orbit the sun. The stars have our backs, but the plans we make for the months ahead are all on us.\nLet's start the year with a clean slate. Here are a few ideas for New Year's resolutions. Simple things like reading, taking nature walks or practicing mindfulness cost nothing and can really boost your quality of life. Or maybe you're dreaming bigger: moving abroad, taking up scuba diving or learning an endangered language? Take a deep breath—and perhaps sleep on it a little longer.",

		"description": "Seeing Venice from above is mesmerising, but this Italian gem's true magic lies within its walls and waterways. Founded in the 5th century on a cluster of islands in the Venetian Lagoon, the early settlement rose from marshland to become a maritime powerhouse. By the Middle Ages, it had evolved into a major hub for trade between Europe and the East, fuelling immense wealth and cultural growth. The city's grandeur shines through its Gothic palaces, Renaissance art and landmarks such as St. Mark's Basilica, the Doge's Palace and the Rialto Bridge.\nVenice is celebrated not only for its iconic architecture and interwoven canals but also for the brilliant minds who shaped its legacy. 'The Travels of Marco Polo' chronicles the adventures of the Venetian merchant and explorer, and Antonio Vivaldi—composer of 'The Four Seasons'—was also born here. The city has inspired timeless works, including Thomas Mann's 'Death in Venice,' Shakespeare's 'The Merchant of Venice' and 'Othello' and Henry James's novella 'The Aspern Papers.'\nToday, Venice balances historic charm with modern challenges—from preserving fragile architecture to managing tourism. Gondolas glide past centuries-old facades, while festivals like Carnevale keep traditions alive.",

		"description": "Our picture of the day takes us to the Swiss village of Lauterbrunnen, where the Staubbach Falls shimmers in the distance beyond a quiet alpine valley. This is the landscape a young traveller, J.R.R. Tolkien, crossed during a hiking trip in 1911, long before he became the storyteller behind 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit.' Its soaring cliffs, silver waterfalls and crisp mountain air left a lasting impression and are believed to have inspired his vision of Rivendell, the elven refuge hidden deep in Middle-earth.\nOn January 3—Tolkien's birthday—fans across the globe celebrate Tolkien Day, raising a toast at 9 PM to 'The Professor.' The tradition, started by The Tolkien Society in 1972, recalls both Frodo's toast to Bilbo and the writer's years at Oxford, where he spent a lifetime shaping modern fantasy—interweaving language, legend and moral courage into timeless tales. Today, admirers honour not just an author but a world-maker—one who showed that even the smallest journey can lead to greatness, and that wonder awaits, ever-present, just beyond the familiar.",

		"description": "Kings Mountain in Alaska's Chugach Mountains isn't just another bump on the horizon—it's the kind of rugged beauty that makes you slow down and stare. Rising over 1,700 metres and sitting roughly 35 kilometres northeast of Palmer, this peak towers over mile 75 of the Glenn Highway, a route famous for its dramatic scenery. Its slopes bear the marks of ancient glaciers, etched into ridges and valleys that seem tailor-made for adventure.",
